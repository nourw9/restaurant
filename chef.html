    Born in Lebanon, Mabrouke knew straight away that the cooking life chose him,
    <br>
     which is why he started working at Bliss, a very popular local joint,
     <br> where over 20 years of culinary experience was injected into him. In 2017,
     <br> he decided to follow his dream of creating his own Middle Eastern comfort food restaurant, therefore joining forces with Ralph Shehfe and creating Lebanese 
     <br>Diner, resulting in elevating the Lebanese food scene in Cairo forever. He now serves as the Head Executive Chef there.
